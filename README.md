# RaidSummon2
WoW Classic World Buff Summoning Addon

This addon is a fork of RaidSummon: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/raidsummon

### Original Description from CurseForge:

#### RaidSummon
#### Update on development
Due to Corona and the AQ Opening i dont have enough time to play and develop the Addon as much as i want. But since the gates are now open on Lucifron, i will have more time to look at all the Github merge requests and localizations. Thank you for your support. More updates on the beta release types will come soon.

#### Usage
Raidmembers can type a special keyword in the raidchat (123, summon, sum or port)
Their names will be added to the summon list and syned to all warlocks using the addon
The name can be left clicked to target the raidmember CTRL+left click to remove a member from the list (synced - name will be removed from all addon users)
Finally summon the member with right click and send a message to the raid / whisper (member will be removed from the list - synced)
Drag the frame by holding SHIFT+left click

#### Configuration
Open the configuration menu with /rs config or /raidsummon config or via the addon menu

#### Combat Lockdown
Due to Blizzard restrictions it is not possible to update the summon frame during combat, however after leaving combat it may take up to 10 seconds for the name to be displayed.

#### Bugs
Please report any bugs to my GitHub site at https://github.com/isitLoVe/RaidSummon/issues
